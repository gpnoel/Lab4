README for Graigor Pierre-Noel

The files I submitted were in the form of index.* and I hope that isn't a problem. They are in that naming format because I had to serve the project locally and naming the html as index makes it work.

likes: I looked online for how to format the ajax calls but didn't use any of those sources. Instead I was able to figure out the syntax and see that I needed to call responseData.playlist in the .each loop because how I formatted my json. After that point it was intuitive to be able to call data from my json

dislikes:

obstacles: Chrome wouldn't recognize my flag to turn off web security and allow file access from files so that was a hinderance
