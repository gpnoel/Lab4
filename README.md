README for Graigor Pierre-Noel

likes: I looked online for how to format the ajax calls but didn't use any of those sources. Instead I was able to figure out the syntax and see that I needed to call responseData.playlist in the .each loop because how I formatted my json. It made sense how the ajax function passed the data to the success functoin. After that point it was intuitive to be able to call data from my json. I also learned how to run a http-server which was cool

dislikes: N/A

obstacles: Chrome wouldn't recognize my flag to turn off web security and allow file access from files so that was a hinderance
